Lawfare,Delhi High Court backs influencers’ right to fact-based criticism,Delhi,2025,4/28/2025,"The Delhi High Court ruled that social media influencers can criticise brands if their statements are backed by scientific evidence. Dismissing San Nutrition’s plea against negative whey protein reviews, the Court upheld the right to satire, hyperbole, and fair commentary under free speech, balancing consumer interests and business reputations.
The Delhi High Court on Monday, April 28th, ruled that social media influencers are permitted to make critical statements against consumer brands, provided such statements are backed by scientific evidence. The Court made this observation while rejecting San Nutrition Private Limited’s plea for an interim order to restrain four influencers from publishing negative reviews of its whey protein products.
Justice Amit Bansal, presiding over the matter, held that placing restrictions on the freedom of speech and expression before a full trial would be unreasonable. “Reasonable criticism, comment and parody is largely protected within the right to free speech under the Constitution,” the Court said.
It further noted that hyperbole, exaggerated speech, and parody do not entitle a party to interim relief, and restricting such speech would deprive the public of vital information, particularly concerning health.
San Nutrition had approached the Court against influencer Arpit Mangal, alleging that his remarks about their whey protein products were disparaging and defamatory. The Court was tasked with examining whether such influencer commentary amounted to defamation, disparagement, or trademark infringement, and to determine the scope of freedom of speech in this context.
Recognising the constitutional significance of the case, the Court invited submissions from Advocates Aditya Gupta and Varun Pathak, representing Google and Meta respectively, as amici curiae. The amici emphasised that cases like these typically engage three causes of action: defamation, disparagement, and trademark infringement, each with distinct legal standards.

Lawfare,Karnataka HC quashes case over Jain University skit with derogatory portrayal of Ambedkar (update on 2023 case),Karnataka,2025,3/2/2025,"A group of students had performed a skit featuring a man from a lowered caste background attempting to date a dominant caste woman, making controversial wordplays including altering Ambedkar’s name to “Beer Ambedkar.”
The Karnataka High Court has quashed criminal proceedings against seven students and two faculty members of Jain (Deemed-to-be) University’s Centre for Management Studies (CMS), over a skit they performed during a college festival, which was allegedly derogatory towards BR Ambedkar and Dalit communities. The case, based on a complaint filed by the Social Welfare Department, accused the participants of promoting caste discrimination and violating laws related to hate speech and atrocities against Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST) communities.
Justice SR Krishna Kumar, in his order, ruled that the charges under sections 153-A (promoting enmity between different groups), 149 (unlawful assembly), and 295-A (deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), as well as sections 3(1)(r)(s) and (v) of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, did not hold up under legal scrutiny. The court said the necessary elements constituting these offences were absent, particularly as the skit did not appear to have been performed with intent to insult or harm any specific community.

Policies/Regulation,"New income tax bill proposes allowing officers access to your email, social media",Applicable Across India,2025,3/5/2025,"The new bill gives tax officers the authority to access computers, emails, and social media accounts, raising privacy concerns.
Tax officers can access your emails and social media, etc. from next year
The new bill allows overriding passwords and security codes
Experts are concerned about misuse of power and privacy invasion
The new income tax bill has recently been in the news, and not for the reasons taxpayers would hope. While the government said it’s all about simplifying tax laws, buried within the bill is a provision that hands sweeping powers to tax authorities allowing them to dig through emails, trading accounts, social media profiles, and more during tax investigations.
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman introduced the revamped Income Tax Bill, 2025, in Parliament, calling it an overhaul of the six-decade-old tax framework. But before it becomes law, a select committee will review it. And the key concern is a clause that expands the scope of tax searches beyond what’s currently allowed to include “virtual digital spaces”
Right now, tax officers can ask for access to laptops, hard drives, and emails, but since the current tax law doesn’t explicitly mention digital records, such demands often face legal pushback. However, the new bill makes it clear: tax authorities can demand access to digital assets, and if a taxpayer refuses, they can bypass passwords, override security settings, and unlock files.
